The recruitment at AeroTéc consisted of two phases:
  - 1. Introductory report on basic eletronic concepts
  - 2. Program an aircraft simulator with control implemantion based on the book [Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice](https://uavbook.byu.edu/doku.php)

## 1st Phase

The report focused on the basic components one is expected to find in a basic small aircraft, such as LiPo bateries, ESCs and motors.

As a final objective, it was also expected to obtain the capacity of an ideal batery given some flight parameters and aircraft information.

## 2nd Phase

The book given which you can acess in the link above explains in detail how to implement a simulation for a MAV(miniature air vehicle).

The purpose of this was to do chapters 1 to 6 which approaches the following topics:
  - Coordinate Frames
  - Kinematics and Dynamics
  - Forces and Moments
  - Linear Design Models
  - Autopilot Design Using Successive Loop Closure

The program was done in Matlab following the instructions given in the uav book.

This day I received my diploma officializing my membership in AeroTéc as an active member of the eletronics team of the project Olisspo Air Team:
