HS Robotic Logo Arm is a a robotic arm that is able to reproduce drawing made in real time either by a tablet or by camera.

On this day the project team was assembled.

I am the project manager responsible to ensure the project continuity and work development.

The team was divided into two categories:
  - Drawing code
  - Arm code/construction

My main focus will be in developing the drawing software in **_OpenCV_** and **_C++_**.
