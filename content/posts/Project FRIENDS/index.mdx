FRIENDS (Fleet of dRones for radIological inspEction, commuNication anD reScue) is a project of research and development that addresses the quick characterization of the geographic extent of radiological contamination by a fleet of drones equipped with advanced technologies of sensors.

After receiving an email about a robotics themed thesis I replied asking if there were any opportunities in the same area but for a second-year student.
Luckily the reply was about FRIENDS.

I joined the team and started to work alongside professors Alberto Vale, Rodrigo Ventura and Lu√≠s Pinto.
My main task is related to the building of the drones as well as technical work!
